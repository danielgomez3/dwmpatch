Subject: [PATCH] Add support for managing external status bars

This patch allows dwm to manage other status bars such as
polybar/lemonbar without them needing to set override-redirect. For
all intents and purposes, DWM treats this bar as if it were its own
and as a result helps the status bar and DWM live in harmony.

This has a few advantages
* The bar does not block fullscreen windows
* DWM makes room for the status bar, so windows do not overlap the bar
* The bar can be hidden/killed and DWM will not keep an unsightly gap
  where the bar was
* DWM receives EnterNotify events when your cursor enters the bar

To use another status bar, set usealtbar to 1 in your config.h and set
altbarclass to the class name (can be found using xprop) to the class
name of your status bar. Also make sure that if your status bar will
be displayed on top, topbar is set to 1 in your config, and if it will
be displayed on bottom, topbar is set to 0. This patch does not
support bars that are not docked at the top or at the bottom of your
monitor.

The patch is developed at https://github.com/mihirlad55/dwm-anybar
